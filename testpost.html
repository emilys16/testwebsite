        <h1>Climate Change and the Environmental - Visualization</h1>

        <p>Below is a graph on climate change. The graph compares the differences between average winter temperatures from 1900 to 2018 (The Learning Network, 2019). Looking at the graph, it is clear that over the 118 years of data, the climate temperature has been rapidly increasing. There has been a steady increase in temperature over time after 1945, with the last cold winter going below 5F in 1979. Based on the data below, it is clear that this drastic temperature change has harmed the environment.</p>
        <p>The New York Times is a generally reliable and unbiased news source for all audiences. However, further information about the article&#39;s author is needed to evaluate the data quality and expertise of the journalist from <em>The Learning Network</em> column. Without knowing the identity of the graph and article authors, readers may question the credibility of the information.</p>

            <p>The visualization above effectively communicates the impact on the climate and environment over time. This stationary, nonuniform example of the timeline effectively reveals the patterns of climate change by clustering the timed winter events together (Meirelles, 2013). The same graphical conventions used for Joseph Priestly&#39;s &quot;<em>Chart of Biography</em>&quot; for effective maps, timelines, and graphs remain unchanged; this includes a timescale, time indicators, thematic sections, line indicators, line differentiators, and colour code (Meirelles, 2013). The visualization meets the requirements of the geographical conventions by inscribing the dates along the timeline from 1900 to 2018, using line length to depict the duration of the winter climate data, and colour coding to differentiate the data between warm and cold.</p>
            <p>Through further research, NASA states that &quot;changes to Earth&#39;s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment&quot; (NASA). Due to the climate crisis, the environment has experienced extreme weather, such as wildfires, droughts, and cyclones. This visualization and further research have increased the understanding of the environment since it has graphically shown the rising and rapid impact.</p>
